# Check Irreducible Polynomial
This is a python script to check whether your polynomial is irreducible or not

This script uses different criterions like Eisenstein's criterion, Perron's criterion, and Cohn's criterion, and will not guarantee that your polynomial is reducible.

This will only use several criterions to check, and might not be correct

But if a polynomial is indeed irreducible, this script will show you the solution to prove that the polynomial is irreducible using one of the criterions
