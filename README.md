# Check Irreducible Polynomial
This is a Python script to check whether your polynomial is irreducible or not and give you a solution if it is, with the help of the Sympy library.

This script uses different criterions like Eisenstein's criterion, Perron's criterion, and Cohn's criterion.

If a polynomial is indeed irreducible, this script will show you a mathematical proof to prove that the polynomial is irreducible using one of the criterions.
